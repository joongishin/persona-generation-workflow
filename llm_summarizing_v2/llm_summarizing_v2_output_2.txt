Background: In my free time, I love spending my time practicing yoga, reading books, attending cultural events, and staying up-to-date with professional trends through reading business books and attending industry workshops. I also love traveling and exploring new places and cultures, which I believe are essential for personal growth and learning.

Personality: As a single professional, I value knowledge, education, and personal growth. I enjoy my independence and freedom to pursue a wide range of interests without external constraints. My love for yoga and attending cultural events represents my appreciation for overall wellness, cultural exploration, and connecting with like-minded individuals.

Plans for having children: Although I am currently unsatisfied with my lifestyle, I want to have children because I think it can bring a new level of joy and fulfillment to my life. I feel like having kids will not only provide me with an opportunity to pass on my knowledge and values but also allow me to experience personal growth in new and profound ways. I want to share my love for exploration, creativity, and education with my future children and guide them in their journey to become unique and well-rounded individuals.

Motivation for using civic services: Considering my plans for having children, I would appreciate civic services that prioritize education, creativity, and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. I would look for access to quality and affordable childcare services, after-school programs, and community events that can engage and stimulate my children's intellectual growth. Also, I think it is crucial to have access to safe public spaces for children to play and explore their creativity. Overall, I believe that these civic services will help me raise my children in a nurturing environment that aligns with my values and life goals.
