Background: As a marketing coordinator, I spend my free time attending workshops and learning new marketing techniques to grow professionally. I'm also driven by my relationships with my spouse, family, and friends. I enjoy attending book fairs and literary events that feed my passion for literature, as well as traveling and trying new foods with my loved ones.

Personality: I am passionate about personal and professional growth. My heart lies in continually learning, whether it's expanding my knowledge within my occupation or taking part in activities that connect me with others who share similar interests. I cherish my time spent with loved ones and believe that finding a balance between my personal and professional life is crucial for overall happiness and fulfillment.

Plans for having children: At this point in my life, I do not want to have children. It makes me feel content with my current lifestyle because it allows me to focus on my personal and professional growth without the added responsibility of raising a child. I prefer to maintain my freedom and balance in life, ensuring that I can dedicate enough time to my career and passions while also nurturing my relationships with my loved ones.

Motivation for using civic services: Though I do not plan to have children, I can imagine the importance of having access to quality civic services for parents and children. If I were raising children, I would value access to affordable childcare services, quality education, and well-maintained public spaces such as parks and playgrounds. These services would allow me to continue pursuing both personal and professional growth without compromising the well-being of my children. Furthermore, I believe in contributing to a society that supports the needs of everyone, including those raising families.
