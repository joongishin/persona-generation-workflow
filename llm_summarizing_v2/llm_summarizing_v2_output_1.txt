Background: In my free time, I enjoy attending various networking and startup events, as well as exploring my creative side through digital art and content creation. I prioritize my health through physical fitness, practicing mindfulness, and trying new experiences, such as different cuisines and traveling.

Personality: What I value the most in my life is personal growth, continually learning, and improving both personally and professionally. I cherish my relationships and prioritize the people who bring joy and happiness to my life. I'm also passionate about staying healthy, physically and mentally, through activities like exercise, meditation, and yoga. Additionally, I love creating meaningful connections with others and making a positive impact on the world.

Plans for having children: While I do have plans for having children someday, I am currently focused on my career and personal growth. I want to be in a stable and secure position financially before starting a family. I believe that by focusing on my personal development and experiences, I will be better equipped to provide my future children with the best possible life.

Motivation for using civic services: Considering my background and values, I believe that having access to quality civic services related to my future family would be immensely helpful. For instance, reliable and affordable childcare and early education programs would offer peace of mind when it comes to raising my children while maintaining my career aspirations. Additionally, access to safe, community-based resources and outdoor spaces would enrich my children's lives and let us stay active and healthy. It makes me feel secure knowing that there are services in place that align with my priorities for both my personal life and my future family.
