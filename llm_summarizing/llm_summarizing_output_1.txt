Background: I love to spend my free time attending professional events, creating content on social media, managing my business, and staying physically and mentally active. I enjoy trying new activities, exploring new cultures, and reading books to broaden my horizons and enhance my knowledge. I cherish the time spent with my loved ones and am passionate about my career.

Personality: I value creativity, growth, and living an authentic life. Balancing a demanding career with my personal life and hobbies, I strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I place great importance on staying up-to-date with the latest trends and constantly improving myself both professionally and personally. I also prioritize my health and well-being by practicing mindfulness, staying physically active, and investing in my relationships.

Plans for having children: Currently, I am not planning on having children, as I am focused on my career and personal development. However, I do see myself having a family someday in the future when I feel more prepared and stable. I want to make sure that when the time comes, I can provide for my children and give them the best life possible.

Motivation for using civic services: As someone who envisions raising children in the future, having access to affordable quality education, healthcare, childcare services, and outdoor recreational activities would be extremely helpful. These services would not only benefit me as a parent but also contribute to the overall well-being and success of my children and the community. Additionally, resources that support entrepreneurs like myself in the workforce and create job opportunities would also be valuable.
