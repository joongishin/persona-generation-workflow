Background: I find great joy in immersing myself in the world of creativity, be it through art, design, or various cultural events. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new trends and attending exhibitions to stay inspired. I also appreciate the importance of personal growth and learning, which I often achieve through travel and exposure to different cultures.

Personality: My life is centered around valuing creativity, self-expression, and personal growth. I actively seek out meaningful experiences that enable me to explore new ideas and perspectives. This thirst for knowledge, combined with my passion for creativity, drives me to constantly broaden my horizons and connect with people who share the same values.

Plans for having children: Although I am currently single and mostly unsatisfied with my current lifestyle, I want to have children in the future. I believe that raising a family will bring a new level of joy and fulfillment to my life, as well as a sense of purpose and legacy. In addition, I am excited to share my values of creativity, self-expression, and personal growth with my future children and support them in their own individual journeys.

Motivation for using civic services: As a parent, I would greatly benefit from access to civic services that prioritize education, creativity, and cultural enrichment. Affordable and accessible after-school programs, community events, and mentorship initiatives would help ensure a well-rounded experience for my children. Moreover, access to affordable and reliable childcare services, healthcare, and support for working parents would greatly contribute to our overall well-being. I also hope for more public spaces that promote creativity and self-expression, such as community art galleries and cultural festivals, which would allow my family to continuously grow and learn together.
