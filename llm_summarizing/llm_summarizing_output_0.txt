Background: As a creative professional, I spend my free time engaging in activities that fuel my passion and help me grow in my industry. This can include reading books, attending art exhibitions, workshops, conferences, and networking events. I love to explore new perspectives and appreciate different forms of creativity while maintaining a strong bond with my family and friends.

Personality: I am deeply passionate about my work and personal development. I enjoy staying informed about current trends and connecting with like-minded individuals in my field. I find fulfillment in attending events and expanding my skills. I value personal freedom and independence, and I aim to find a balance between my personal and professional life.

Plans for having children: I have chosen not to have children. I believe there are many fulfilling ways to make a positive impact on the world and build meaningful relationships without becoming a parent. My career and personal passions take priority in my life, and I feel content with my decision to focus on those main priorities.

Motivation for using civic services: While I do not plan to have children, I understand the importance of quality civic services for those who do. If I were a parent, I would seek services such as accessible and affordable childcare, quality education options, reliable public transportation, and community centers that offer a safe and engaging environment for children. Although these services may not directly apply to me, they still play a crucial role in building a close-knit and well-supported community for everyone.
